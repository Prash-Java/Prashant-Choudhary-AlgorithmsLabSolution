a,) This problem statement includes two questions, the first one is Transaction one which is present in dsalabsession package and next question is implemented in driver 
and service package with respective classes,
b.) Second method is also created as notesCountCurrencyImplementation() which is particularly useful if we can find gcd in straight forward manner, Problem statement had discussed
specific to INDIAN Currency with notes denominations as 100, 500, 2000 and in this case 100 is GCD, so method 2 in service class can also be used particularly in this case of INDIAN Currency, so it is just presented there and is commented code snippet, only for illustration
Thank You
